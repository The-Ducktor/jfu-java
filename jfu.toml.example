# jfu Configuration File
#
# This is an example configuration file for the jfu build tool.
# Copy this file to `jfu.toml` in your project root and customize as needed.

# Source directory containing your Java files
# Defaults to "." (current directory) if not specified
src_dir = "."

# Output directory for compiled .class files
out_dir = "./out"

# Location of the build cache file
cache_file = "./jfu-cache.json"

# Default entrypoint when no file is specified in commands
# This is the file that will be used when you run:
#   jfu build    (without specifying a file)
#   jfu run      (without specifying a file)
#   jfu tree     (without specifying a file)
#
# Useful when you have multiple classes with main() methods
entrypoint = "Main.java"

# JVM options to pass when running your program
# These are applied when using `jfu run`
jvm_opts = [
    "-Xmx512m",           # Maximum heap size
    "-Xms256m",           # Initial heap size
    # "-XX:+UseG1GC",     # Use G1 garbage collector
    # "-ea",              # Enable assertions
    # "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"  # Set file encoding
]

# ]
#
# [compiler]
